    <p id="n">Being in nature, or even viewing scenes of nature, reduces anger, fear, and stress and increases pleasant feelings.

They say, <b><i>“Beauty lies in the eyes of the beholder”</i></b>, but what they don’t say is, sometimes the sight in front of you turns out to be so marvellous that even the cynic starts to believe in better things.</p>
